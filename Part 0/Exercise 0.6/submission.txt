note on browser:
spa.js intercepts the form submission request
and overrides the default processing of the
event. it rather assigns the note value to
the content parameter of a javascript note
object, along with the current timestamp [Date()]
and appends it to the JSON string containing
the existing notes, before calling the redrawNotes()
function to re-render the notes and send a POST
request of the new note to the server if
it is in a ready state
end note
